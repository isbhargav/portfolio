## Who am I?


Hi, I’m currently a graduate student at Lakehead University My coursework is mostly realted to Machine Learning and Deep Learning.However, I’m always curious! I love to learn in general especially a new stack/technology. My focus right now is to learn the most I can in terms of different technologies and specialize later!

I love cs, so I do cs

I am really interested in:

- programming competitions
- technology
- algorithms & data structures

- AI & machine learning

I am just an enthusiast, but a really motivated one :D

Feel free to message me about anything related to tech, I’m always open to a conversation!

## Work Experience



### Web Developer (part-time) April 2021 – June 2021

***Vingo Consulting Brampton, ON***

- Developed Single Page Applications at various scales with React. Used Gatsby and GrpahQL to build websites
    powered by the JAMStack.
- Build React Components and pages with content coming from a headless CMS (Contentful).
- Performed various SEO optimizations.

### Python Automation Engineer May 2020 – Dec. 2020

***Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Toronto, ON***

- Worked as a part of QE Anti Money Laundering (AML-IT) team developing test automation for financial
    applications. Worked with various technology stack and testing frameworks like Nodejs, Pyspark, Selenium, Ready
    API, and Robot Framework.
- Developed test automation for data-heavy back-end applications and interacting with different ETL pipelines and
    Unix servers.Implemented End-to-End test automation with proper test setup and tear down to ensure all tests
    were consistent and repeatable. Setup triggers with CI/CD pipeline. Achieved 90% Test coverage.
- Developed a Web tool to parse propitiatory format files that helped reduce the manual testing effort for the client.

### Project Research Intern Jan. 2019 – April 2019

***PRL, Department of Space, India Ahmedabad, Gujarat***

- Developed a fully automated solution to collect spectral emission data using night-glow emission spectrograph. The
    goal was to automate it to collect the data from sunset to sunrise based on location and day of the year.
- Analyzed the collected data from spectrograph to predict the temperature of the upper atmosphere during the
    period using various signal analysis algorithms. Generate analysis report in postscript format to observe/monitor
    the effect over a long period of time
- The spectrograph is deployed at PRL Observatory and the whole project was done in MATLAB and the SDK
    provided by the manufacturer.

### SWE Summer Intern May 2018 – June 2018

***Infostretch, India Ahmedabad, Gujarat***

- Developed MEAN Stack application for the company’s Internal assessment platform. Worked extensively with
    Nodejs and MongoDB to rebuild and improve their existing technology stack.
- Designed the database, Developed Restful APIs, and algorithms to efficiently solve problems.
- Worked with various industry experts and gained some insights into the tech industry through personal discussions
    and talks.

## Projects

### Image Classifier on SUN397 dataset|Python, Pytorch, FastAI Fall 2020

- Developed a DCNN Classifier to Classify images from SUN397 dataset into 397 different classes using transfer
    learning.
- Learned to use Tensorflow/Keras and Pytorch, how to deal with huge dataset without causing memory overflow,
    training model on cloud and to use various keras callbacks to optimize training time.
- Used various techniques such as Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, Feature Fusion Technique, Discriminative
    Learning Rate, One-cycle Policy to improve accuracy of the model.

### Crime Analysis and Forecasting|Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sci-kit learn Fall 2019

- The project focuses to use past records of crime incidents in Vancouver to pre- dict(classify) danger of specific type
    of crime occurrence at specific Neighbourhood for certain day of week and time.
- We try to predict most probable location of crime based on previous reportings for given Date,Time,Neighbourhood
    and Crime Type. Worked with Various Machine learning frameworks like Numpy, Pandas, Sci-kit learn, ..etc.

### Gujarati Wordnet Python API|Python, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK Winter 2019

- Developed a Python wordnet API for Gujarati language using Indo-Wordnet Database. The API can be used by
    anyone who is interested in doing NLP Research with Gujarati Language.
- You can use the API to get word similarity, antonynms, synonyms, root word ..etc. The module is developed using
    Numpy, Pandas, NLTK framework.
